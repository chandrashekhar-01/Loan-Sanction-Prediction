# Loan Sanction Prediction  

This project predicts loan approval status based on applicant details using Machine Learning techniques in **R**. It focuses on data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation to assist financial institutions in decision-making.  

# Features  
- Data preprocessing and normalization.  
- Training and validation data split.  
- Model evaluation with performance metrics.  
- Feature importance analysis.  

## Requirements  
Install the following R libraries before running the code:  
- `randomForest`  
- `caret`  
- `e1071`  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Load the dataset `Loan_dataet_cleaned_normalized.csv`.  
3. Ensure the required libraries are installed.  
4. Execute the script to train and evaluate the model.  

## Output  
- Confusion matrix for model performance.  
- Feature importance plots.  
- Visualizations for tree size and proximity.
